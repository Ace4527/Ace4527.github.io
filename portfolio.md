I served as the programmer on the Bee Survival project, and was responsible for most of the game code. I also was part of the team responsible for designing the gameplay and mechanics.  
  
The brief for this project was very open ended, the team was given a theme and a time frame and told to produce a prototype, which was then explored further to produce the game with a further alotment of time. This gave us the opportunity to explore ideas and formats that interested us.
  
I enjoy taking real life inspiration to create a game where others can share in that experience. This game was inspired by my dad's beekeeping hobby and the many challenges faced by bees in today's world.

The Little Wizard's Prison Escape project was produced by a small team, of which I was the lead programmer and gameplay mechanic designer. I created all the player mechanics and also implemented all the enemy scripts.  
  
This project was exciting to work on as it is my first cross platform game for Playstation and Windows, the opportunity to work with Playstation was a great experience.

# Racer Prototype
![Racer Prototype](/assets/images/Racer_Prototype.PNG "Racer Prototype"){:class="img-responsive"}
Racer prototype was a proof of concept project undertaken to implement physics based player movment and AI pathfinding in a game scenario. The AI car utilises A* pathfinding to navigate the racetrack by simulating inputs to control the vehicle.
  
It was interesting to explore a physics based movement system in this project. The movement of the cars needed to feel realistic to the player. This was also my first time creating an independent AI agent in a game environment which was enlightening and satisfying to see it racing around the track.
