My name is Nathan. I am an aspiring game programmer, proficient in C++ and Unity Engine.  
  
I am in the process of finishing my final units at Torrens University, where I'm studying a Bachelor of Software Engineering (Game Programming). I am scheduled to graduate mid 2022. 
   
Some of my favourite games include Civilization V and VI, Dungeons and Dragons Online, the Mass Effect Trilogy, Genshin Impact, and Life Is Strange.  
  
I love designing games with immersive, branching character development and meaningful decisions. I am detail-orientated and task-driven, and enjoy finding simple solutions to complex problems. I find it satisfying to work in a team environment where we can work together, using our diverse skillsets to bring virtual worlds to life that others can explore.
