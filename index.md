My name is Nathan. I am an aspiring game programmer, proficient in C# and Unity Engine with some experience with C++ as well as Unreal Engine.  

I have just finished my Bachelors degree in Software Engineering (Game Programming) at Torrens University Australia and am looking for opportunities in the gaming industry.
      
I love designing games with immersive, branching character development and meaningful story decisions. I am detail-orientated and task-driven, and enjoy finding simple solutions to complex problems. I find it satisfying to work in a team environment where we can work together, using our diverse skillsets to bring virtual worlds to life that others can explore.

Some of my favourite PC games include Life Is Strange, Sid Meier's Civilization V and VI, Dungeons and Dragons Online, the Mass Effect Trilogy, and Horizon Zero Dawn.
I am also an avid board gamer, enjoying co-op board games with my favourites being Spirit Island and Wingspan. I am also enjoying playing Gloomhaven digital edition when we have the time.
