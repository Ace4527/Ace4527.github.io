My name is Nathan. I am an aspiring game programmer, proficient in C#, C++ and Unity Engine.  

I have just finished my Bachelors degree in Software Engineering (Game Programming) at Torrens University Australia.
   
   
I love designing games with immersive, branching character development and meaningful decisions. I am detail-orientated and task-driven, and enjoy finding simple solutions to complex problems. I find it satisfying to work in a team environment where we can work together, using our diverse skillsets to bring virtual worlds to life that others can explore.

Some of my favourite games include Civilization V and VI, Dungeons and Dragons Online, the Mass Effect Trilogy, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Life Is Strange.
